# Project ideas

Projects that I want to tackle in my leisure time.

## Stuff with music

* App that detects songs and scrobbles them to last.fm (a bit like Shazam just with a last.fm integration)
* App that analyzes listening habits from last.fm users based on genre 
* App that analyzes listening habits from last.fm users based on diversity of the bands

## Language stuff

* Show random word in danish (after page load) - maybe even with translater function

## Angular

* Try Last.fm integration
* Personal book database with a document-based DB
